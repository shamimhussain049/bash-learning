#In this script, the first line #!/bin/bash is called a shebang, which specifies the interpreter that should be used to execute the script (in this case, Bash).

The next two lines use the echo command to print a greeting message and the current date and time to the terminal. The $(date) syntax is a command substitution that inserts the output of the date command into the message.

To run this script, save it to a file (e.g., greeting.sh) and make it executable using the chmod +x greeting.sh command. Then, simply run the script using ./greeting.sh and you should see the output in the terminal.
